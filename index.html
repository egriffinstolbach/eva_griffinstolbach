    <info class="Summary">
        <p>Kid Camp is a summer day camp for adventurous Chicago kids ages 7-13 (flexibly). We're based in Hyde Park, but we travel all over the city. Campers vote on each day's activities, learning about democracy and compromise, fostering independence, and giving them a great camp experience. Counselors Eva and Alan make suggestions and lead votes, and rules exist for safety purposes, but the kids make most decisions for themselves.</p>
        <p>Kid Camp has been described as babysitting in the style of a summer camp, meaning it feels like a camp to the kids, but it allows campers and families the flexibility of babysitting. Camp activities include playgrounds, beaches, museum trips, arts and crafts, cooking and baking, tree climbing, exploring downtown, and much more.</p>
        <p>Each week is capped at eight kids. This size allows for a variety of interests and personalities, but still creates a tight-knit group of kids who are usually great friends by the end of the week. The mixed age group is also an important part of the Kid Camp experience. 7-year-olds and 13-year-olds play together, and often older kids take on a leadership role within the group.</p>
        <p>We let kids be kids and play on their own terms. Kid Camp is best for imaginative, adventurous, creative, cooperative and active kids.</p>
        <p>Please contact Eva with any questions via egriffinstolbach@gmail.com</p>
        <p>Note: Kid Camp is legally group babysitting, not a summer camp.</p>
