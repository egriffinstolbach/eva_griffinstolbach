        <h>What to Bring to Camp:</h>
        <p>• Comfortable backpack your child will carry</p>
        <p>• Reusable water bottle (full at the beginning of the day)</p>
        <p>• Sunscreen (on them at the beginning of the day and in their backpack)</p>
        <p>• Nutritious lunch and snack (note: Kid Campers are allowed to eat when they're hungry, so many kids like to have bits and pieces to snack on throughout the day. Also, please keep sweets minimal as we have popsicles at the end of each day.)</p>
        <p>• Access to public transit (usually kids have Ventra cards, a bag of quarters also works. CTA charges 75 cents for kids 6-13)</p>
        <p>• Swimsuit and towel (even if the weather looks bad)</p>
        <p>• Make sure your child is wearing comfortable, action-ready, weather-appropriate clothes and shoes (no flip-flops!), and please send a change of clothes if you think they will need it (their clothes are likely to get dirty, grass-stained, wet, etc.)</p>
        <p>• Reading material. We pick a read-aloud book each week, so if your child has any suggestions for that, have them bring those books in on the first day of camp. They might also like to have their own reading material.</p>
        <p>• Please do not send pocket money to camp with your child. If we plan an activity that requires a small amount of money, like a Chinatown trip or lunch out, we'll let you know ahead of time. We also like the kids to earn their own money through bake sales or lemonade stands.</p>
        <p>• If your child has a phone, they can have it with them in their backpack. Unless there is an emergency, that is where it will stay throughout the day. Please make sure they understand that phone games and social media are not acceptable camp activities.</p>
        <p>• Please send a signed waiver (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f00niu4GdefJrjtE-iz86G4uoRUVXfH8lumFB5kA0q0/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>) and the remainder of payment due with your child on the first day of camp.</p>
