        <h>Sample Camp Day:</h>
        <p>9:00am -- Arrival and Planning</p>
        <p>9:15am -- Head to the park, continue planning</p>
        <p>9:30am-11:00am -- Playground, tree climbing, read aloud, hammock, elevensies, etc.</p>
        <p>11:00am -- Head out for the day's main event, usually on public transportation</p>
        <p>12:00-12:30 -- Lunch</p>
        <p class="Activity">12:30-3:30 -- Main activity of the day. Favorite past destinations include Northerly Island Beach, Chinatown, the Art Institute, Millenium Park, and Maggie Daley Park. We also often stay in Hyde Park, frequenting Nichols Park, Harold Washington Park, Butternut Park, 57th Street Beach, and Promontory Point.</p>
        <p>3:30 -- Head home, often with a stop at a playground if there's time</p>
        <p>4:30-5:00 -- Popsicles and pick-up</p>
        <p>Because every camp day is different, this is very vague. Some days are action-packed and some days we hang out at the park nearly all day reading. That's part of what is so awesome about Kid Camp.</p>
        <p>We are always open to suggestions from families about fun things to do. If you know of something going on in the city during camp that you think would be a good activity for us, please let us know!</p>
